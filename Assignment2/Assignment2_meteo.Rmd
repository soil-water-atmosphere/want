# Introduction to transient turbulent transfer in the stably stratified boundary layer
The figure below shows a potential temperature profile with height for specific conditions. We will produce a comparable graph in this assignment, but now transient factors are taken into account.

# The model setup
The state variable and the flow domain of the model will be the same as in assignment 1, the potential temperature is denoted by $\theta$ and its units are in Kelvin (K).

# Internal fluxes
Flux of energy in the x-direction (height) is calculated using Fick’s law with a so-called eddy-diffusivity:

$$q=-K_{eddy}*\frac{\delta \theta}{\delta x}$$
Where in the case of non-linear diffusion with the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and with a neutrally stratified boundary layer, $k_{eddy}$ is described by:

$$K_{eddy}=ku_{*}z$$

where the Von Kármán constant $k$ equals 0.4 and $u_{*}$ denotes the friction velocity at the surface.

# External fluxes
