# Introduction
Here, you will combine the topics of the previous two assignments. Until now, you have dealt with systems that have a state that is a function of time $s(t)$, such as the emptying reservoir, and with systems that are steady state in time but vary in space $s(x)$, such as the stationary advection-diffusion equation. Now, you will analyze systems that have a state that varies in time and in space $s(x,t)$.

# Part 1 - Clarifying the last missing parts
## Section 1.1 - Notation
Until now, we have been using two different notations when talking about discretisation of equations. Namely the following;

$$
s_i\\
s(x)\ \text{or} \ s(t)
$$
The first notation signifies the location in discrete space, which also refers to its location in the corresponding vector. $i$ is therefore always a positive integer. The second one is a specific value. It describes the state of a system at for example `x = 12.5` meters or the state at a specific time. When talking about space and time at the same time these notations tend to become quite cumbersome as you can see in the following example:

$$
s(x + \Delta x, t + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t)
$$
To solve this issue we will use the following notation during this tutorial:

$$
s^{t + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t}_{x + \Delta x}
$$
This equation means exactly the same as the equation above but in a much shorter notation. The convention is to put time above and space below. The same goes for the discrete form, where $n$ refers to the time index, and $i$ to the space index:

$$
s^{n + 1}_{i}
$$
Thus, this specific location refers to the next time-step `n+1` (current time step: `n`) and at the current location `i`.

## Section 1.2 - Crank-Nicolson
The Crank-Nicolson method is another way of solving ODEs in time. What it does in simple words, it averages for each time step the solution of an explicit and an implicit scheme. In mathematics, it looks as follows:

$$
\dfrac{ds}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}f(t) + \frac{1}{2}f(t+\Delta t)
$$
A strategy that is often used to be able to solve the explicit, implicit and Crank-Nicolson (CN) scheme at once is to use the omega notation:

$$
\dfrac{ds}{dt} = \omega f(t) + (1-\omega)f(t+\Delta t)
$$
By setting up a solver using $\omega$, you can solve for all three methods, and easily switch. If you plug in $\omega = 1$ you get the explicit solution, $\omega = 0$ the implicit solution and $\omega = \frac{1}{2}$ the Crank-Nicolson version. This convention makes programming the three down the line much more convenient.

# Part 2 - The advection-diffusion equation revisited
## Section 2.1 - Setting up the equations
We will go back to the advection difussion equation now, which was introduced in the second assignment. In the second assignment, we worked with this equation only in the stationary case; $\dfrac{ds}{dt} = 0$. This is the full version of the equation.

$$\frac{\partial s}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial s}{\partial x} + D\frac{\partial^{2}s}{\partial x^{2}}$$

If you are in for a **challenging** assignment, you can open **Exercise 1** from the `Finite_difference_3_extended.Rmd` markdown.

### Discretisation
The first step in the discretisation is choosing the differencing scheme for the time and space derivatives. An often used approach is the forward in time and central in space scheme (FTCS scheme). We will follow that scheme here.

First, we apply the forward scheme in time (first in the original notation and then in the short notation of section 1.1):
$$
\dfrac{ds}{dt} = \dfrac{s(x, t+\Delta t) - s(x, t)}{\Delta t} = f(x,t,s(x,t))\\
\dfrac{s^{n+1}_{i} - s^{n}_{i}}{\Delta t} = f(x,t,s(x,t))
$$

The second step is the realisation that the omega implementation (as discussed in section 1.2) will change the right-hand side of this equation to:

$$
\dfrac{s^{n+1}_{i} - s^{n}_{i}}{\Delta t} = \omega\ f(t,s(t)) + (1-\omega)\ f(t+\Delta t,s(t+\Delta t))
$$

<div class="exercise">
2.1.1 Replace function $f$ in the equation above by the right-hand side of the advection diffusion equation. Use the central scheme for both the first and second-order derivative in space. 
</div>

<div class="answer">
$$
\dfrac{s^{n+1}_i - s^{n}_{i}}{\Delta t} = 
\omega\ \left(-u\dfrac{s^{n}_{i+1}-s^{n}_{i-1}}{2\Delta x} + D\dfrac{s^{n}_{i-1}-2s^{n}_{i}+s^{n}_{i+1}}{\Delta x^2} \right) 
+ (1-\omega) \left(-u\dfrac{s^{n+1}_{i+1}-s^{n+1}_{i-1}}{2\Delta x} + D\dfrac{s^{n+1}_{i-1}-2s^{n+1}_{i}+s^{n+1}_{i+1}}{\Delta x^2} \right)
$$ 
</div>

The final result of this discretisation is the matrix equation
$$M s^{n+1} = v$$
In order to achieve that, the answer of question 2.1.1 can be rewritten in the form:

$$
as^{n+1}_{i-1} + b s^{n+1}_{i} + c s^{n+1}_{i+1} = d
$$

<div class="exercise">
2.1.2 Rewrite the equation obtained in question 2.1.1 in the matrix-form as shown above. Find the coefficients `a`, `b`, `c` and `d`. TIP!: move as a first step all states of the next time step to the left-hand side and the states of the current time step to the right-hand side;
$$
f(s^{n+1}) = g(s^{n})
$$
</div>

<div class="answer">
$$
a s^{n+1}_{i-1} = -(1-\omega) \left(-u\dfrac{-s^{n+1}_{i-1}}{2\Delta x} + D\dfrac{s^{n+1}_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2} \right)\\
a = (\omega-1)\left(\dfrac{u}{2\Delta x} + \dfrac{D}{\Delta x^2} \right)
$$
$$
bs^{n+1}_{i} = \dfrac{s^{n+1}_{i}}{\Delta t} - (1-\omega) \left(D\dfrac{-2s^{n+1}_{i}}{\Delta x^2} \right)\\
b = \dfrac{1}{\Delta t} + (\omega-1)\left(\dfrac{-2D}{\Delta x^2}\right)
$$
$$
c s^{n+1}_{i+1} = -(1-\omega) \left(-u\dfrac{s^{n+1}_{i+1}}{2\Delta x} + D\dfrac{s^{n+1}_{i+1}}{\Delta x^2} \right)\\
c = (\omega-1) \left(\dfrac{-u}{2\Delta x} + \dfrac{D}{\Delta x^2} \right)
$$
$$
d = \dfrac{s^{n}_{i}}{\Delta t} + \omega\ \left(-u\dfrac{s^{n}_{i+1}-s^{n}_{i-1}}{2\Delta x} + D\dfrac{s^{n}_{i-1}-2s^{n}_{i}+s^{n}_{i+1}}{\Delta x^2} \right)
$$
</div>

The matrix equation will then look like this:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1&.&.&.&.\\
a&b&c&.&.\\
.&a&b&c&.\\
.&.&a&b&c\\
.&.&.&.&1
\end{bmatrix} \cdot 
\begin{bmatrix}
s^{n+1}_{1}\\
s^{n+1}_{2}\\
s^{n+1}_{3}\\
s^{n+1}_{4}\\
s^{n+1}_{5}
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
b_l\\
d_2\\
d_3\\
d_4\\
b_r
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Section 2.2 - Setting up the program
In the time practical, all calculations required an initial state to calculate the future time-steps. To solve an equation in space and time, exactly the same initial state is needed. The difference is, however, that a state on all locations needs to be given. The initial state is therefore a vector. 

In this tutorial, we choose a Gaussian as an initial state vector for the advection-diffusion equation, because of its ability to show the performance of a numerical scheme visually. This could be thought of as a pulse going through the system.

<div class="exercise">
2.2.1 Run the following chunk and plot the `init.state` variable. 
```{R}
# Input variables
domain  = c(0,100)
endtime = 20
dx      = 1
dt      = 1
u       = 1
D       = 1
bl      = 0
br      = 0
omega   = 0

# Function that gives the states for the first time-step
initfun = function(x)
{
  # Gaussian distribution
  exp(-(x-domain[2]/2)^2/2^2)
}

# Calculation preparation
x           = seq(domain[1],domain[2],by=dx)
N           = length(x)
init.state  = initfun(x)
```
</div>

<div class="exercise">
2.2.2 Construct the matrix and invert it. You can do it first on paper and then implement it into the chuck below. TIP: You can make use of the coefficients `a`, `b` and `c` to define simpler code, but it is not required.

<div class="answer">
```{R matrix_construction_student}
# MATRIX CONSTRUCTION

# Fill in a dirichlet boundary conditions for the solution.
M[1,1] = 1
M[N,N] = 1
a      = (omega-1) * ( u/(2*dx) +   D/dx^2 )
b      = (omega-1) * (          - 2*D/dx^2 ) + 1/dt
c      = (omega-1) * (-u/(2*dx) +   D/dx^2 )

for(i in 2:(N-1)){
  M[i,i-1] = a
  M[i,i  ] = b
  M[i,i+1] = c
}

Minv = solve(M)

    {
        v[i] = prev.state[i]/dt + omega*(-u*(prev.state[i+1]-prev.state[i-1])/(2*dx)
             + D*(prev.state[i+1]-2*prev.state[i]+prev.state[i-1])/dx^2)

## Section 2.3 - Stability of the solution
The advection-diffusion equation is an equation that tends to get unstable pretty fast. To examine this behaviour, two different parameters are used; the Von Neumann and Courant number. These are defined in the following way:

$$
V = \dfrac{2D\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}\\
C = \dfrac{u\Delta t}{\Delta x}
$$

<div class="question>
2.3.1 Fill in the following table by using the chunk below. Use the filled in part of the table as settings for the model and write the Von Neumann and Courant number down and classify the performence of the model as:

* Good (G)
* Wrong amplitude (A)
* Oscillating (O)
* Unstable (U)

2.3.2 Explain the effect of the different values u,D, $\Delta t$,$\Delta x$ and the different schemes on the performance and stability of the solutions. TIP!: use the von Neumann and Courant number
</div>

<div class="answer">
Without diffusion, the solutions gets unstable. Decrease $\Delta t$ and the solution gets more stable. Increase $\Delta x$ and the solution gets more stable. The implicit scheme is always stable but the amplitude tends to be too low. Explicit schemes tends to get unstable very fast. CN scheme lies in the middle. It does not get unstable, the amplitude is well-preserved, but the tail oscillates pretty easily.
