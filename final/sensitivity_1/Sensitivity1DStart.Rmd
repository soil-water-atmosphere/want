# Learning goals
*  Performing local sensitivity analysis on a simple model 
*  Understanding that sensitivity can vary over a domain 
*  Understanding the influence of the epsilon value on the results of the sensitivity analysis

*  Understanding the influence of the base value on the results of the sensitivity analysis

# Important: Varying external fluxes or boundary conditions 
So far, when we defined external input or a boundary condition, they were either fixed or we had to redefine our model. 
For example, we would define precipitation in our model in the following way:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
P = 0.001
add.spatialflux(GWmodel,P,"recharge")
```
Whenever we would call our model, it would take 0.001 for P, even if we had redefined P already in our memory. This makes it quite demanding to sample the value of P, because then we would first have to remove the first spatial flux, and add the new one, each time when we want to adapt the value of P. Therefore, the package has a trick to resolve this. If you define P between quotations when you add the spatial flux: 
```{r,eval=FALSE}
P = 0.001
add.spatialflux(GWmodel,"P","recharge")
```
it will read the last value of P from memory, in stead of the value of P it had at the moment that the spatial flux was added to the model. So, whenever you plan to vary spatial fluxes or boundary conditions, you could use this. 


# Setting up a stationary groundwater model

## Introduction
In this assignment you will conduct your own sensitivity analysis on the parameters of a groundwater model. The model you will study simulates a groundwater extraction well that is located next to a nature reserve (depicted by the reed vegetation), as shown in the figure below. A river is situated on the left side of the nature reserve. We want to investigate which parameter of our 1D groundwater model has most influence on the groundwater level in the nature reserve. Therefore, we will conduct a local sensitivity analysis.\


![1D saturated stationary groundwater model](1Dsensmodel.png)   

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(FVFE1D)
```

## The mathematical setup
First, build the 1D groundwater model in the same way as the ones you built in earlier assignments. 
These are the specifics for the model:

- Domain from 0 to 500
- The system internal flux is a Dupuit flux with transmissivity $kD$ 
- The $kD$ changes linearly between the left and the right side of the domain
- Take these values for transmissivity: kDl = 55 (left), kDr = 35 (right)
- There are two external fluxes: There is a constant spatial recharge flux (rainfall) of 0.001, and there is an extraction well, extracting 0.35 at point 275 (extracting implies that this appears as -0.35 on the balance).   
- The right hand side is a water divide, implying a zero flux boundary, which is automatically applied as the default in the FVFE1D package.

## The numerical setup
- Divide the domain into 50 nodes
- Use Finite Volumes as numerical technique

## Run the model
- Solve and run the model

<div class="exercise">
Implement the model as described above. Check the hints if necessary. Don't forget to remove the eval=FALSE statement:
```{r, eval=FALSE}

<div class="answer">
```{r}
# Domain
domain = c(0,500) 

# Internal flux
kDl = 55
kDr = 35
kD.fun = approxfun(domain,c(kDl,kDr)) #gives a (linear) function for the transmissivity

  {
  return(-kD.fun(x)*gradstate)
  }

# Define the model

set.discretisation(GWmodel,nodes,"FV")

```
</div>


## Choice of MRESULT
Now we start with the first step of the sensitivity analysis; defining the model output for which we want to investigate how model parameters influence this output. Below we define a function that calculates the output that we are interested in for this exercise:  
```{r}
MRESULT = function()
{
  XS = dataframe.states(GWmodel)
  MH = mean(XS[(XS$x>125)&(XS$x<200),"state"])
  return(MH)
}
```

<div class="exercise">
What does the defined `MRESULT` mean in water management terms?
</div>

<div class="student_answer">
Write your answer here...
</div>

<div class="answer">
The `MRESULT` function calculates the mean groundwater level in the nature area. We are interested in the effect of the extraction well on the nature reserve. The groundwater level at the location of the reserve is therefore an important model output.
</div>

# Sensitivity analysis
You will now conduct your own local sensitivity analysis on the model we just created.

<div class="exercise">
Analyse the sensitivity of the model states and MRESULT to all the parameters of the model. Finish the script below by systematically and one-by-one adding the steps of sensitivity analysis as discussed in the lectures.
</div>

**Define base-value and scale of variation of all parameters**

The parameter values defined before will form the base values:
```{r}
base= list(kDl=kDl,kDr=kDr,P=P,Qwell=Qwell,hl=hl)
str(base)
```

Now define the scale of variation:

*  for the transmissivities, let the scale of variation be 1 times the base value at the left side of the domain, and 7.5 times the base value on the right side   
*  for the spatial external fluxes, let the scale of variation be 25% of the base value   
*  for the point external fluxes, let the scale of variation be 40% of the base value (note that a scale of variation cannot be negative - think about why)
*  for the left boundary condition, let the scale of variation be 5 cm.

<div class="exercise"> Adapt the list below according to the descriptions above, don't forget to remove the eval=FALSE statement:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
scale= list(kDl = ...,
            kDr = ...,
            P = ...,
            Qwell = ...,
            hl = ...)
#str(scale)
```
</div>

<div class="answer">
```{r}
scale= list(kDl = 1*kDl,
            kDr = 7.5*kDr,
            P = 0.25*P,
            Qwell = -0.4*Qwell,
            hl = 0.05)
str(scale)
```
</div>

<div class="exercise">
How do you determine the scale of variation, if it is not given? (such as in this exercise)
</div>

<div class="student_answer">
Write your answer here...
</div>

<div class="answer">
The defined scale of variation is highly critical, because it influences the results of the senstivity analysis, but is also highly subjective. The scale of variation can be inspired by literature research (a parameter turns out to vary between several values), it can be based on repetition of measurements (determining the standard deviation among the different measurements) or can be based on prescribed accuracy of the measurement device (often, measurement devices indicate their accuracy in the manual).   
</div>


**Perform the base run and store the model results, in M_base (our target variable) and state_base (states of base run)**
```{r}
M_base = MRESULT()
print(M_base)
state_base = dataframe.states(GWmodel)$state
```

**Define the epsilon-value (step-size)**

<div class="exercise">
Think about a reasonable step-size for epsilon, and adapt accordingly. Don't forget to remove the eval=FALSE statement:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
eps = ...
```
</div>

<div class="answer">
```{r}
eps = 1e-3
```
</div>

**Calculate parameter sensitivity** 
<div class="exercise">
Complete the following script and repeat this for every parameter value separately. 
```{r}
#Add epsilon-value to base-value of parameter P, keep all other parameters at base-value

# Rerun the model

# Set parameter P back to base value (for next parameter)

# Calculate the sensitivity of MRESULT to parameter P 

# Calculate the sensitivity of the model states to parameter P

**Determine relative contribution of each parameter to variation in model output** 

So far, we have determined to what extent each parameter influences the model output, but we don't know their relative contribution yet (i.e., which parameter has most influence on the model output) because the sensitivity that we calculated for each parameter has different units (check this!). Furthermore, we have to account for the scale of variation. 

<div class="exercise">
Complete the following script to determine the relative contribution of each parameter to variation in MRESULT:
```{r}
# Calculate the partial variances of all parameters using the scale of variation

# Calculate the total model variance

# Determine the relative contribution of each parameter and plot the results in an informative way 


```

</div>

<div class="exercise">
Why do we use variances rather than standard deviations? 
</div>

<div class="student_answer">
Write your answer here...
</div>

<div class="answer">
Because variances can be added, and standard deviations not (see derivation in the lecture slides). We want to know the total model variance, and we can achieve this by adding up all the partial variances caused by the tested parameters. In this way, we can determine the relative contribution of each parameter to variation in model output. 
</div>

**Relative contribution of each parameter to variation in whole domain**  
We can repeat the analysis of the previous section (where we focussed on one specific model output, MRESULT) for all simulated states over the model domain. 

<div class="exercise">
Complete the following script to determine the relative contribution of each parameter to variation in model states over the model domain:
```{r}
# Calculate the partial variances of all parameters using the scale of variation

# Calculate the total model variance

# Plot the results in an informative way 


```
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Does the sensitivity vary over the domain? Does this align with our expectation?
</div>

<div class="student_answer">
Write your answer here...
</div>

<div class="answer">
The contributions differ between parts of the domain:   
*  left: the boundary condition is the main source of variation   
*  middle : Qwell is most important, followed by recharge      
*  right: the value of the right-side transmissivity is most important.   
This all makes sense; the parameters are most sensitive in the region that they tend to describe - it would for instance be counterintuitive if kDl was more sensitive than kDr in the right part of the domain. 
</div>



<div class="answer">
**Sensitivity with respect to kDl**

```{r,fig.height=4}
kDl=base$kDl+eps
kD.fun = approxfun(domain,c(kDl,kDr)) # the kD.fun has to be recreated whenever the kD values are changed
control = solve.steps(GWmodel)
kDl=base$kDl
kD.fun = approxfun(domain,c(kDl,kDr)) 
dMdkDl  = (MRESULT()-M_base)/eps
print(paste("dM/dkDl=",dMdkDl))
dstatedkDl = (dataframe.states(GWmodel)$state-state_base)/eps
plot(nodes,dstatedkDl,type="l",lwd=3,col="blue",main="d{state}/d{kDl}")
abline(h=0,col="red",lwd=3)
grid(col="black")
```

Increasing the left value of the kD clearly decreases the groundwater levels over the whole domain.
On the left edge, the sensitivity is zero due to the boundary condition set there.

**Sensitivity with respect to kDr**

```{r,fig.height=4}
kDr=base$kDr+eps
kD.fun = approxfun(domain,c(kDl,kDr)) 
control = solve.steps(GWmodel)
kDr=base$kDr
kD.fun = approxfun(domain,c(kDl,kDr)) 
dMdkDr  = (MRESULT()-M_base)/eps
print(paste("dM/dkDr=",dMdkDr))
dstatedkDr = (dataframe.states(GWmodel)$state-state_base)/eps
plot(nodes,dstatedkDr,type="l",lwd=3,col="blue",main="d{state}/d{kDr}")
abline(h=0,col="red",lwd=3)
grid(col="black")
```

Increasing the right value of the kD decreases the groundwater levels mainly on the right hand side of the well. On the left hand side the change is almost zero.

**Sensitivity with respect to P**

```{r,fig.height=4}
P=base$P+eps
control = solve.steps(GWmodel)
P=base$P
dMdP  = (MRESULT()-M_base)/eps
print(paste("dM/dP=",dMdP))
dstatedP = (dataframe.states(GWmodel)$state-state_base)/eps
plot(nodes,dstatedP,type="l",lwd=3,col="blue",main="d{state}/d{kP}")
abline(h=0,col="red",lwd=3)
grid(col="black")
```

Increasing the rainfall causes groundwater level increases through the whole domain. On the left edge of the domain, the rate of change is zero due to the fixed state  boundary condition. The sensitivity increases gradually towards the right.

**Sensitivity with respect to Qwell**

```{r,fig.height=4}
Qwell=base$Qwell+eps
control = solve.steps(GWmodel)
Qwell=base$Qwell
dMdQwell  = (MRESULT()-M_base)/eps
print(paste("dM/dQwell=",dMdQwell))
dstatedQwell = (dataframe.states(GWmodel)$state-state_base)/eps
plot(nodes,dstatedQwell,type="l",lwd=3,col="blue",main="d{state}/d{Qwell}")
abline(h=0,col="red",lwd=3)
grid(col="black")
```

Increasing the Qwell (so lowering the extraction rate) causes the groundwater level to increase throughout the whole domain. 
On the left edge, the change is zero due to the fixed state boundary condition. To the right of the well the change is constant. 

**Sensitivity with respect to hl**

```{r,fig.height=4}
hl=base$hl+eps
control = solve.steps(GWmodel)
hl=base$hl
dMdhl  = (MRESULT()-M_base)/eps
print(paste("dM/dhl=",dMdhl))
dstatedhl = (dataframe.states(GWmodel)$state-state_base)/eps
plot(nodes,dstatedhl,type="l",lwd=3,col="blue",main="d{state}/d{hl}")
abline(h=0,col="red",lwd=3)
grid(col="black")
```

Increasing the left boundary condition (river level) causes groundwater levels to increase by the same amount everywhere (dstate/dhl = 1).

**Contributions to  variance of M**

Partial variances:

```{r}
varM.kDl   = (scale$kDl*dMdkDl)^2
varM.kDr   = (scale$kDr*dMdkDr)^2
varM.P     = (scale$P*dMdP)^2
varM.Qwell = (scale$Qwell*dMdQwell)^2
varM.hl    = (scale$hl*dMdhl)^2
varMtot = varM.kDl+varM.kDr+varM.P+varM.Qwell+varM.hl
```

Relative contributions with pie chart:
```{r}
relvarM = list(kDl = varM.kDl/varMtot,
             kDr = varM.kDr/varMtot,
             P  = varM.P/varMtot,
             Qwell = varM.Qwell/varMtot,
             hl = varM.hl/varMtot)

str(relvarM)
pie(as.numeric(relvarM),labels=names(relvarM),
    main=paste("Standard deviation of M =",round(sqrt(varMtot),4),"m"),
    col = rainbow(length(relvarM)))
```

The scale of variation of the mean groundwater level in the nature reserve is 60 cm!
By far the largest contribution comes from the variation of the $Qwell$. 
Large, but second is the contribution of the rainfall. Also the left-side transmissivity 
has a visible contribution. The contributions of the other parameters can be neglected.

**Contributions to variation over the whole domain**

Partial variances:

```{r}
varState.kDl = (scale$kDl*dstatedkDl)^2
varState.kDr = (scale$kDr*dstatedkDr)^2
varState.P  = (scale$P*dstatedP)^2
varState.Qwell = (scale$Qwell*dstatedQwell)^2
varState.hl = (scale$hl*dstatedhl)^2
varStateTot = varState.kDl+varState.kDr+varState.P+varState.Qwell+varState.hl
```

Plot the scale of variation of the states over the whole domain:
```{r}
plot(nodes,sqrt(varStateTot),type="l",col="blue",lwd=3,
     ylab="standard deviation [m]",xlab="x",main="Total scale of variation of groundwater levels")
grid(col="black")
```

We see that the largest uncertainty is at the right boundary: over 250cm.
The scale of variation increases over the domain going from left to right, with a small peak at the well. 

A plot giving an overview of the relative contributions:
```{r}
plot(nodes,rep(1,length(nodes)),ylim=c(0,1),type="l",
     ylab="relative contribution to variance",xlab="x",
     main="Contribution to scale of variation of groundwater levels")

cols = rainbow(5)
lines(nodes,varState.kDl/varStateTot,col=cols[1],lwd=2)
lines(nodes,varState.kDr/varStateTot,col=cols[2],lwd=2)
lines(nodes,varState.P/varStateTot,col=cols[3],lwd=2)
lines(nodes,varState.Qwell/varStateTot,col=cols[4],lwd=2)
lines(nodes,varState.hl/varStateTot,col=cols[5],lwd=2)
legend("topright", bty="n",
   legend=c("kDl","kDr","P","Qwell","hl"),lty=1,col=cols,
   horiz=TRUE)
```

The contributions differ between parts of the domain:   
*  left: the boundary condition is the main source of variation   
*  middle : Qwell is most important, followed by recharge      
*  right: the value of the right-side transmissivity is most important.   

The *local sensitivity analysis* shows that the variation of the groundwater extraction rate has a large influence on the uncertainty in M. When looking at the groundwater levels over the whole domain, the rainfall, river level and right-side transmissivity are also important sources of uncertainty, depending on the location in the domain.
</div>

# Influence of base value, epsilon value *eps*, and scale of variation
The results of local sensitivity analysis depend on several "choices". 
First of all, the base value has to be determined. The base value is often identified through a calibration procedure. Secondly, we have to choose a 'disturbance' `eps` that is added to the parameters one by one, and lastly, we have to determine the scale of variation, which can be a challenging task.  

<div class="exercise">
Change the base value of any of the parameters. Do you see any clear changes in the local sensitivity analysis?
</div>

<div class="student_answer">
Fill in your answer here...
</div>

<div class="answer">
This depends on which value you adapted, and how much it was changed. Generally, results will change for a different base value, because a different part of the model response is investigated. Think about the lecture slides: sensitivity is the slope of the tangent (NL: raaklijn) around the base value. When evaluating a different base value, this might change the slope of the tangent. 
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Make the `eps` a factor 10 larger. Do you see any clear changes in the local sensitivity analysis?
</div>

<div class="student_answer">
Fill in your answer here...
</div>

<div class="answer">
This depends on which value you chose for *eps* in the first place. If *eps* was chosen rather small (e.g. 10^-3), there will only be very small changes. This is probably because the epsilon value is still quite small relative to the scale of variation of the parameters. Note that an elegant solution would be to make the size of *eps* dependent on the scale of variation! This is especially useful if parameter values differ several orders of magnitude.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
Change the scale of variation of any of the parameters. Do you see any clear changes in the local sensitivity analysis?
</div>

<div class="student_answer">
Fill in your answer here...
</div>

<div class="answer">
This, again, depends on how much you changed what. But it will influence the results; the scale of variation is needed to calculate the relative contribution of each parameter to the total model variance. If the scale of variation is increased, it increases the sensitvity of the model to this parameter. Intuitively, this makes sense; a large scale of variation means that the parameter is highly uncertain. This uncertainty propagates into the model results.
